Pageflip5 v1.45 - README FIRST!

	Pageflip5 includes a basic level copy protection feature preventing unauthorized use of the book on homepages, or publications. This protection does not limit the License owner in any way; the use of the created Book is limited by the License holder. 

	By default, Pageflip5 can be used offline, on localhost (and localhost:8888) but if you wish to publish it (online or offline) You have to create your own Key.
	
	The Pageflip5 protection prevents unauthorized use - copying in similar format, or reconfigured as a new publication - of the Book created and published by the License owner.
	User can protect the publication by entering a valid code sequence, generated by the online Key Generator (http://pageflip-books.com/keygen.php), in the Configuration Object.
	Furthermore, License owner receives a LicenseKey, a code of 11-14 characters, at the purchase of the License, without which the Key Generator cannot be used.

	With the help of the protection, License owner can limit the domains on which Pageflip5 can be run, including offline running, and can specify a message that cannot be modified later by others. With a valid Key, Pageflip5 runs normally on the authorized domains, but in case the check finds an error, Pageflip5 will not start.

	Please read the online documentation (http://pageflip-books.com/documentation.php) getting started part, about how to unlock your Pageflip.

	IMPORTANT!
	Some browsers default security settings doesn't allow offline running Pageflip5 (except the offline safe template), because it uses AJAX requests to load html data. Firefox seems to be always working, Safari needs the html document locally to be re-saved. Chrome and Opera doesn't allow it. You can either upload it on a server, or a localhost, or embed all external HTML contents like the control bar and the PageData file. In each case, use the on-line Key Generator (http://pageflip-books.com/keygen.php) to enable your domains.
